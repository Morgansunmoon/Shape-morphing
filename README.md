![Figure_1](https://github.com/Morgansunmoon/Shape-morphing/assets/166150257/21cbb92d-aa30-4a00-9dad-98dea79b6de2)

1. Code_1.nb is the function to calculate the cutvature of  tensile-induced shape morphing.
2. Code_2.nb is the function to deduce the theoretical model for predict critical angle.
3. Code_3.nb is the function to show inverse design strategy for case 1.
4. Code_4.nb is the function to deduce the theoretical model for gripper force.

A Mechanically Robust and Facile Shape Morphing Using Tensile-Induced Buckling
1. Code_1.nb is the function to calculate the cutvature of  tensile-induced shape morphing.
2. Code_2.nb is the function to deduce the theoretical model for predict critical angle.
3. Code_3.nb is the function to show inverse design strategy for case 1.
4. Code_4.nb is the function to deduce the theoretical model for gripper force.
